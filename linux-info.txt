Create a Systemd Service Unit:

#Create a systemd service unit file (e.g., your_script.service) to define the service and specify the path to your Python script:

            [Unit]
            Description=Your Python Script Service

            [Service]
            Type=oneshot
            ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your_script.py

            [Install]
            WantedBy=multi-user.target
#Replace /usr/bin/python3 with the path to your Python interpreter (you can find it by running which python3) and /path/to/your_script.py with the actual path to your Python script.

Create a Systemd Timer Unit:

Create a systemd timer unit file (e.g., your_script.timer) to define the timer:


            [Unit]
            Description=Run Your Python Script Every 5 Days

            [Timer]
            OnBootSec=5days
            OnUnitActiveSec=5days
            Unit=your_script.service

            [Install]
            WantedBy=timers.target
            This configuration schedules the service to run every 5 days starting from boot or whenever the timer becomes active.

Enable and Start the Timer:

Enable the timer to ensure it starts at boot:

            sudo systemctl enable your_script.timer

Start the timer:

            sudo systemctl start your_script.timer

Check Timer Status:

You can check the status of the timer using:

        sudo systemctl list-timers


This will display a list of active timers along with their next run time.

Now, your Python script will be executed every 5 days, and it will also run automatically after a server restart.

Please make sure to replace your_script.py and adjust paths as needed in the service and timer unit files to match your specific script and directory structure.
